I got the data of the application I developed from a service. In order to use the frontend side of the project, you must first download the backend service and run it with a node in your local. I am sharing the command of this repository clone below:
git clone https://github.com/mertct11/crea-node.git

After cloning the project, go to the relevant directory (node is installed on your computer) and run your "node index.js" command.
The project is expected to be up and running on the local 1556 port.

	
	# Step 2 Frontend setup 
	
Now let's clone the frontend side of the project. we can run the following code block in an available directory.
git clone https://github.com/mertct11/crea-app.git

Let's go down to the project directory and install the npm packages in the same way:
npm i --save
And
To get the project up and running:
npm runstart
Let's run the command. the project will run at local:3001.
